# Tkinter_checklist_SQLite
 This is a basis checklist that can be used in a corporate environment by multiple persons at the same time. It uses the Python library Tkinter as Graphical User Interface and SQLite as database. Warnings when a deadline is close is part of this checklist. Interesting things to add: Menubar, auto file checking, auto opening, triggers
